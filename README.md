Contact Tracing - Canada

Canada doesn't have officially a national app yet.

**ABTraceTogether** - provided by the the Government of Alberta Health Services. It's a BT proximity tracing solution based on a fork of [OpenTrace](https://github.com/ct-report/opentrace) = data log/collection are decentralized (device) and ID & contact tracing/match management are centralized (backend).

When an user tests positive, he's asked to upload the collected data from his device to the backend.

It requires mobile phone number registration. Only +1 numbers (Canada and USA) are allowed.
